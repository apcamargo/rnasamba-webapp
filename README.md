# rnasamba-webapp

## Build and launch

```
$ docker-compose up -d --build
```

This will expose the app on port 80 and a Flower server for monitoring Celery workers on port 5555.

To add more Celery workers, start the compose with multiple `worker` containers:

```
$ docker-compose up -d --build --scale worker=3
```

To shut down:

```
$ docker-compose down
```
